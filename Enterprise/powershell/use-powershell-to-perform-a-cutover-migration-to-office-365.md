# <a name="use-powershell-to-perform-a-cutover-migration-to-office-365"></a>使用 PowerShell 來執行完全移轉至 Office 365

You can migrate the contents of user mailboxes from a source email system to Office 365 all at once by using a cutover migration. This article walks you through the tasks for an email cutover migration by using Exchange Online PowerShell. 
  
By reviewing the topic, [What you need to know about a cutover email migration to Office 365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=536688), you can get an overview of the migration process. When you're comfortable with the contents of that article, use this one to begin migrating mailboxes from one email system to another.
  
> [!NOTE]
> You can also use the Exchange admin center to perform a cutover migration. See [Perform a cutover migration of email to Office 365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=536689). 
  
## <a name="what-do-you-need-to-know-before-you-begin"></a>開始之前有哪些須知？

Estimated time to complete this task: 2-5 minutes to create a migration batch. After the migration batch is started, the duration of the migration will vary based on the number of mailboxes in the batch, the size of each mailbox, and your available network capacity. For information about other factors that affect how long it takes to migrate mailboxes to Office 365, see [Migration Performance](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=275079).
  
You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Migration" entry in a table in the [Recipients Permissions](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=534105) topic.
  
To use the Exchange Online PowerShell cmdlets, you need to sign in and import the cmdlets into your local Windows PowerShell session. See [Connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=534121) for instructions.

## <a name="migration-steps"></a>移轉步驟

### <a name="step-1-prepare-for-a-cutover-migration"></a>步驟 1：準備完全移轉
<a name="BK_Step1"> </a>

- **Add your on-premises Exchange organization as an accepted domain of your Office 365 organization.** The migration service uses the SMTP address of your on-premises mailboxes to create the Microsoft Online Services user ID and email address for the new Office 365 mailboxes. Migration will fail if your Exchange domain isn't an accepted domain or the primary domain of your Office 365 organization. For more information, see[Verify your domain in Office 365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=534110).
    
- **Configure Outlook Anywhere on your on-premises Exchange server.** The email migration service uses RPC over HTTP, or Outlook Anywhere, to connect to your on-premises Exchange server. For information about how to set up Outlook Anywhere for Exchange 2010, Exchange 2007, and Exchange 2003, see the following:
    
  - [Exchange 2010：啟用 Outlook 無所不在](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=187249)
    
  - [Exchange 2007：如何啟用 Outlook 無所不在](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=167210)
    
  - [Exchange 2003：RPC over HTTP 的部署案例](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=73657)
    
  - [如何使用 Exchange 2003 設定 Outlook 無所不在](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=167209)
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Your Outlook Anywhere configuration must be configured with a certificate issued by a trusted certification authority (CA). It can't be configured with a self-signed certificate. For more information, see [How to Configure SSL for Outlook Anywhere](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=80875). 
  
- **Verify that you can connect to your Exchange organization using Outlook Anywhere.** Try one of these methods to test your connection settings:
    
  - 從公司網路之外使用 Microsoft Outlook 連線至內部部署 Exchange 信箱。
    
  - Use the Microsoft [Exchange Remote Connectivity Analyzer](https://www.testexchangeconnectivity.com/) to test your connection settings. Use the Outlook Anywhere (RPC over HTTP) or Outlook Autodiscover tests.
    
  - 在 Exchange Online PowerShell 中執行下列命令。
    
  ```
  $Credentials = Get-Credential
  ```

  ```
  Test-MigrationServerAvailability -ExchangeOutlookAnywhere -Autodiscover -EmailAddress <email address for on-premises administrator> -Credentials $credentials
  ```

- **指派必要權限給內部部署使用者帳戶來存取 Exchange 組織中的信箱。** 您用來連線至內部部署 Exchange 組織的內部部署使用者帳戶（也稱為「遷移系統管理員」）必須具備必要的許可權，才能存取您要遷移至 Office 365 的內部部署信箱。 此使用者帳戶可用來建立內部部署組織的移轉端點。
    
    The following list shows the administrative privileges required to migrate mailboxes using a cutover migration. There are three possible options.
    
  - 移轉系統管理員在內部部署組織的 Active Directory 中必須是 **Domain Admins** 群組的成員。
    
    或
    
  - 移轉系統管理員必須具有每個內部部署信箱的 **FullAccess** 權限。
    
    或
    
  - 在儲存使用者信箱的內部部署信箱資料庫上，移轉系統管理員必須具有 **[以下列接收]** 權限。
    
- **Disable Unified Messaging.** If the on-premises mailboxes you're migrating are enabled for Unified Messaging (UM), you have to disable UM on the mailboxes before you migrate them. You can then enable UM on the mailboxes after the migration is complete.
    
- **Security Groups and Delegates** The email migration service cannot detect whether on-premises Active Directory groups are security groups or not, so it cannot provision any migrated groups as security groups in Office 365. If you want to have security groups in your Office 365 tenant, you must first provision an empty mail-enabled security group in your Office 365 tenant before starting the cutover migration. Additionally, this migration method only moves mailboxes, mail users, mail contacts, and mail-enabled groups. If any other Active Directory object, such as user that is not migrated to Office 365, is assigned as a manager or delegate to an object being migrated, they must be removed from the object before you migrate.
    
### <a name="step-2-create-a-migration-endpoint"></a>步驟 2：建立移轉端點
<a name="BK_Step2"> </a>

To migrate email successfully, Office 365 needs to connect and communicate with the source email system. To do this, Office 365 uses a migration endpoint. To create an Outlook Anywhere migration endpoint for cutover migration, first [connect to Exchange Online](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=534121). 
  
若需要移轉命令的完整清單，請參閱[移動與移轉 Cmdlet](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=534750)。
  
在 Exchange Online PowerShell 中執行下列命令：
  
```
$Credentials = Get-Credential
```

此範例使用 [Test-MigrationServerAvailability](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=534752) Cmdlet 來取得並測試內部部署 Exchange 伺服器的連線設定，然後使用那些連線設定來建立名為 "CutoverEndpoint" 的移轉端點。
  
```
$TSMA = Test-MigrationServerAvailability -ExchangeOutlookAnywhere -Autodiscover -EmailAddress administrator@contoso.com -Credentials $credentials
```

```
New-MigrationEndpoint -ExchangeOutlookAnywhere -Name CutoverEndpoint -ConnectionSettings $TSMA.ConnectionSettings
```

> [!NOTE]
> The **New-MigrationEndpoint** cmdlet can be used to specify a database for the service to use by using the **-TargetDatabase** option. Otherwise a database is randomly assigned from the Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) 2.0 site where the management mailbox is located.
  
#### <a name="verify-it-worked"></a>確認是否正常運作

在 Exchange Online PowerShell 中執行下列命令來顯示 "CutoverEndpoint" 移轉端點的資訊：
  
```
Get-MigrationEndpoint CutoverEndpoint | Format-List EndpointType,ExchangeServer,UseAutoDiscover,Max*

```

### <a name="step-3-create-the-cutover-migration-batch"></a>步驟 3：建立完全移轉批次
<a name="BK_Step3"> </a>

You can use the **New-MigrationBatch** cmdlet in Exchange Online PowerShell to create a migration batch for a cutover migration. You can create a migration batch and start it automatically by including the _AutoStart_ parameter. Alternatively, you can create the migration batch and then manually start it afterwards by using the **Start-MigrationBatch** cmdlet. This example creates a migration batch called "CutoverBatch" and uses the migration endpoint that was created in the previous step.
  
```
New-MigrationBatch -Name CutoverBatch -SourceEndpoint CutoverEndpoint -AutoStart
```

This example also creates a migration batch called "CutoverBatch" and uses the migration endpoint that was created in the previous step. Because the  _AutoStart_ parameter isn't included, the migration batch has to be manually started on the migration dashboard or by using **Start-MigrationBatch** cmdlet. As previously stated, only one cutover migration batch can exist at a time.
  
```
New-MigrationBatch -Name CutoverBatch -SourceEndpoint CutoverEndpoint
```

#### <a name="verify-it-worked"></a>確認是否正常運作

若要確認您已順利為完全移轉建立移轉批次，請在 Exchange Online PowerShell 中執行下列命令來顯示新移轉批次的資訊：
  
```
Get-MigrationBatch | Format-List
```

### <a name="step-4-start-the-cutover-migration-batch"></a>步驟 4：啟動完全移轉批次
<a name="BK_Step4"> </a>

To start the migration batch in Exchange Online PowerShell, run the following command. This will create a migration batch called "CutoverBatch".
  
```
Start-MigrationBatch -Identity CutoverBatch
```

#### <a name="verify-it-worked"></a>確認是否正常運作

If a migration batch is successfully started, its status on the migration dashboard is specified as Syncing. To verify that you've successfully started a migration batch using Exchange Online PowerShell, run the following command:
  
```
Get-MigrationBatch -Identity CutoverBatch |  Format-List Status
```

### <a name="step-5-route-your-email-to-office-365"></a>步驟 5：將電子郵件路由傳送至 Office 365
<a name="BK_Step5"> </a>

Email systems use a DNS record called an MX record to figure out where to deliver emails. During the email migration process, your MX record was pointing to your source email system. Now that the email migration to Office 365 is complete, it's time to point your MX record at Office 365. This helps make sure that email is delivered to your Office 365 mailboxes. By moving the MX record, you can also you turn off your old email system when you're ready. 
  
For many DNS providers, there are specific instructions to [change your MX record](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=279163). If your DNS provider isn't included, or if you want to get a sense of the general directions, [general MX record instructions ](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=397449) are provided as well.
  
It can take up to 72 hours for the email systems of your customers and partners to recognize the changed MX record. Wait at least 72 hours before you proceed to the next task: [Step 6: Delete the cutover migration batch](use-powershell-to-perform-a-cutover-migration-to-office-365.md#Bk_step6). 
  
### <a name="step-6-delete-the-cutover-migration-batch"></a>步驟 6：刪除完全移轉批次
<a name="Bk_step6"> </a>

After you change the MX record and verify that all email is being routed to Office 365 mailboxes, notify the users that their mail is going to Office 365. After this, you can delete the cutover migration batch. Verify the following before you delete the migration batch.
  
- All users are using Office 365 mailboxes. After the batch is deleted, mail sent to mailboxes on the on-premises Exchange Server isn't copied to the corresponding Office 365 mailboxes.
    
- Office 365 mailboxes were synchronized at least once after mail began being sent directly to them. To do this, make sure that the value in the Last Synced Time box for the migration batch is more recent than when mail started being routed directly to Office 365 mailboxes.
    
若要在 Exchange Online PowerShell 中刪除 "CutoverBatch" 移轉批次，請執行下列命令：
  
```
Remove-MigrationBatch -Identity CutoverBatch
```

### <a name="section-7-assign-user-licenses"></a>第 7 節：指派使用者授權
<a name="BK_Step7"> </a>

 **藉由指派授權，為移轉的帳戶啟動 Office 365 使用者帳戶。** 如果您未指派授權，則當寬限期 (30 天) 結束時就會停用信箱。 若要在 Microsoft 365 系統管理中心中指派授權，請參閱[指派或取消指派 Office 365 for business 的授權](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=536681)。
  
### <a name="step-8-complete-post-migration-tasks"></a>步驟 8：完成移轉後工作
<a name="BK_Step8"> </a>

- **Create an Autodiscover DNS record so users can easily get to their mailboxes.** After all on-premises mailboxes are migrated to Office 365, you can configure an Autodiscover DNS record for your Office 365 organization to enable users to easily connect to their new Office 365 mailboxes with Outlook and mobile clients. This new Autodiscover DNS record has to use the same namespace that you're using for your Office 365 organization. For example, if your cloud-based namespace is cloud.contoso.com, the Autodiscover DNS record you need to create is autodiscover.cloud.contoso.com.
    
    如果保留 Exchange Server，您也應該確定自動探索 DNS CNAME 記錄在移轉後必須在內部和外部 DNS 中指向 Office 365，Outlook 用戶端才會連線至正確的信箱。
    
    > [!NOTE]
    >  在 Exchange 2007、Exchange 2010 和 Exchange 2013 中，您也應該將  `Set-ClientAccessServer AutodiscoverInternalConnectionURI` 設為 `Null`。 
  
    Office 365 uses a CNAME record to implement the Autodiscover service for Outlook and mobile clients. The Autodiscover CNAME record must contain the following information:
    
  - **別名：** 自動探索
    
  - **目標：** autodiscover.outlook.com
    
    如需詳細資訊，請參閱[管理 DNS 記錄時為 Office 365 建立 DNS 記錄](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=535028)。
    
- **Decommission on-premises Exchange servers.** After you've verified that all email is being routed directly to the Office 365 mailboxes, and you no longer need to maintain your on-premises email organization or don't plan on implementing a single sign-on (SSO) solution, you can uninstall Exchange from your servers and remove your on-premises Exchange organization.
